A standard Gaussian Blur, blurs the entire picture including the license plate characters making it difficult for the OCR program to covert the image to text. Gaussian Blur is based on distance from the center point, and treats all pixels as the same, therefore it can cause edges of characters to soften. Bilateral Filter adds the capability to check how similar nearby pixels are, based upon gray-scale values and apply a weighted blur to pixels that aren't as similar, allowing us to keep sharp edges of characters.    \n",
